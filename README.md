# Paul George

**Frontend / WordPress developer – Liskeard, Cornwall (UK)**  
Professional web roles since 2006; building for the web since the early 2000s.

I build practical, fast, maintainable sites – not portfolio fluff. Most of my work is for UK estate agents, using a low‑code WordPress/Elementor/Blade stack that I helped design, test and roll out.

- Currently: Frontend Developer at Nurtur Ltd (The Property Jungle brand)
- Focus: WordPress, frontend architecture, build pipelines, internal tools
- Style: Old‑school work ethic, low‑drama, get‑it‑shipped

## 🔧 Tech & tools

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3/Sass, responsive layouts, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap  
- **CMS / backend:** WordPress (custom themes & plugins), PHP, Elementor, Blade/Twig, ACF, Gravity Forms  
- **Workflow:** Git, GitHub, simple CI, Prepros, WP Engine, Linux hosting, DNS/SSL  
- **Other:** Performance tuning, basic accessibility, SEO‑friendly builds, API integrations

## 📌 What I’ve been working on

- Built ~40 WordPress/Elementor sites for UK estate agents in the last year or so, on a shared platform I helped shape.  
- Introduced Git, standardised build tools and a low‑code environment to a legacy agency team so non‑specialists could still ship reliable sites.  
- Ongoing: internal tools and scripts to automate repetitive bits of site builds (assets, checks, small optimisations).
