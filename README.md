# Paul George

I've spent decades navigating the ever-changing landscape of web development, from the templates of the past to the "blazing fast" React websites of today and the WordPress clunkers inbetween. I'm not here to use jargon to make myself feel important. I'm here to bridge the gap between design and technical reality with clean code and a healthy dose of skepticism for over-engineered solutions. I build premium software for clients who are tired of excuses.

In my world, resourcefulness beats academia every day of the week. I leverage AI and my years of experience to build at pace. I'm not afraid to use the latest tech to get you from A to B, because at the end of the day, you aren't paying for my struggle, you're paying for my expertise and a finished product that works.

I’m open to:
- Remote frontend / WordPress roles (UK‑based)
- Short, well‑defined freelance projects
- Consulting to sort out slow, fragile stacks and chaotic web delivery

## 🔧 Tech & tools

WordPress, custom themes & plugins, PHP, HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Twig/Blade, Git/GitHub, React, NextJS, WP Engine and similar managed hosts. Daily user of AI (LLMs) as a second brain and junior dev for refactoring, debugging, tests and docs.

## 💼 Consulting

I offer consulting for websites that are slow, fragile, painful to maintain or just need a spruce-up.

Typical work:
- Site & hosting audits, with a concrete fix list
- Performance / Core Web Vitals improvement
- Copy and content reviews
- Designing low‑code build workflows so sites ship in days, not weeks
- Mentoring devs on frontend, Git and basic DevOps, and showing them how to use AI as a force multiplier
