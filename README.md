# Paul George

Senior / frontend engineer (19 years, UK). I turn messy websites and SME WordPress setups into fast, low‑code, Git‑driven platforms that are quicker to build on, easier to support, and less likely to fall over.

I’m open to:
- Remote frontend / WordPress roles (UK‑based)
- Short, well‑defined freelance projects
- Consulting to sort out slow, fragile stacks and chaotic web delivery teams

## 🔧 Tech & tools

WordPress, custom themes & plugins, PHP, HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Twig/Blade, Git/GitHub, WP Engine and similar managed hosts. Daily user of AI (LLMs) as a second brain and junior dev for refactoring, debugging, tests and docs.

## 💼 Consulting

I offer consulting for estate agents, SMEs and agencies websites that are slow, fragile, painful to maintain or just need a spruce-up.

Typical work:
- Site & hosting audits, with a concrete fix list
- Performance / Core Web Vitals improvement
- Copy and content reviews
- Designing low‑code build workflows (Elementor + templates + Git) so sites ship in days, not weeks
- Mentoring devs on frontend, Git and basic DevOps, and showing them how to use AI as a force multiplier
