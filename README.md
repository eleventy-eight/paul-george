# Paul George

I've spent decades shipping and rescuing real-world sites, from old template stacks to modern React builds and the WordPress clunkers in between. I'm not here to drown you in jargon; I'm here to bridge the gap between design and engineering with clean code and a low tolerance for over-engineered nonsense.

Resourcefulness beats theory every day of the week. I lean on smart tools (including AI) and experience to move fast without trashing maintainability. You're not paying for my struggle, you're paying for my judgment and a finished product that works.

I’m open to:
- Remote frontend roles (UK‑based)
- Short, well‑defined freelance projects
- Consulting to sort out slow, fragile stacks and chaotic web delivery

## 🔧 Tech & tools

WordPress, custom themes & plugins, PHP, HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Twig/Blade, Git/GitHub, React, NextJS, WP Engine and similar managed hosts. Daily user of AI (LLMs) as a second brain and junior dev for refactoring, debugging, tests and docs.

## 💼 Consulting

I offer consulting for websites that are slow, fragile, painful to maintain or just need a spruce-up.

Typical work:
- Site & hosting audits, with a concrete fix list
- Performance / Core Web Vitals improvement
- Copy and content reviews
- Designing low‑code build workflows so sites ship in days, not weeks
- Mentoring devs on frontend, Git and basic DevOps, and showing them how to use AI as a force multiplier
