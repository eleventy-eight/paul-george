# Paul George

**I fix slow, clunky websites and stop new builds turning into bloated disasters.**

Decades of shipping and rescuing real sites, from template stacks to React builds and WordPress messes. I bridge the gap between design and engineering with clean code and little tolerance for over-engineered nonsense.

Resourcefulness beats theory. I use smart tools (including AI) and experience to move fast without trashing maintainability. You're not paying for my struggle, you're paying for my judgment and a finished product that works.

## 🟢 Open to Work

- Remote frontend roles (UK-based)
- Short, well-defined freelance projects
- Consulting to fix slow, fragile stacks and chaotic web delivery

## 🔧 Tech & tools

WordPress, custom themes & plugins, PHP, HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Twig/Blade, Git/GitHub, React, NextJS, WP Engine and similar managed hosts. Daily user of AI (LLMs) as a second brain and junior dev for refactoring, debugging, tests and docs.

## 💼 Consulting

I offer consulting for websites that are slow, fragile, painful to maintain or just need a spruce-up.

Typical work:
- Site & hosting audits, with a concrete fix list
- Performance / Core Web Vitals improvement
- Copy and content reviews
- Designing low‑code build workflows so sites ship in days, not weeks
- Mentoring devs on frontend, Git and basic DevOps, and showing them how to use AI as a force multiplier
